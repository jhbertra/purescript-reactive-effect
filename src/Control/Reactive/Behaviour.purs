-- Behaviours - semantically, `time -> a`.
--
-- The choice of representation for behaviours is based on a practical
-- observation: most behaviours are really stepwise functions of discretely
-- changing values rather than continuous functions of time. We can represent
-- both cases by using a stepwise function of continuous functions that change
-- over time (i.e. a peicewise function).
-- 
-- The resulting representation is practical both for representing "discrete"
-- behaviours, such as the time-varying state of a GUI widget, for which
-- push-based semantics are desirable, as well as "continuous" behaviours, such
-- as simulations, parametric animations, and signals, for which pull-based
-- semantics are preferable, as they allow sampling at arbitrary temporal
-- resolution.
--
-- Additionally, this representation makes it quite convenient to create
-- continuous functions from discrete functions, and vice-versa. For example,
-- given a discrete behaviour, one can create a continuous behaviour via
-- e.g. linear, quadratic, or cubic interpolation. One can also conveniently
-- perform calculus operations such as differentiation or integration using
-- numerical methods, as well as solving differential equations. Finally, one
-- could quantize a continuous behaviour by sampling it with an event.
