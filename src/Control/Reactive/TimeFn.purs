-- | A function over time represented as a data structure that has special
-- | cases for `const` and `lazy` functions. It is useful to be able to
-- | distinguish constant functions from other ones, because in practice, most
-- | behaviours are actually stepwise functions created from discrete events,
-- | and not continuous functions of time. In such cases, we want to avoid
-- | unnecessarily resampling a value we know will not change.
-- |
-- | The instances for `TimeFn` endeavour to preserve and create `K` functions
-- | as much as possible for this reason. This is also the reason why `TimeFn`
-- | values that are lazily evaluated have their own constructor rather than
-- | being defined using `defer f = F \time -> evalTimeFn (f unit) time`,
-- | because such a definition would make all lazy constant functions
-- | indistinguishable from continuous functions.
